   player join the game.
3. Bullet is on automatic mode. Slightly changing the code you can make in manual mode.
4. I have commented the code of "Player Dies" in client.py file. If you want you can uncomment the code.
   When it is fit by the meteor then player will dies.

   player which will reflect in the gamecreen. Like when player moves it reflect on the other player 
   screen.

   of SHA-256.

Now you can enjoy the Game.
